Korean Lyrics:
Yeah 누가 내 수저 더럽대
I don't care 마이크 잡음 금수저 여럿 패
버럭해 잘 못 익은 것들 스테끼 여러 개
거듭해서 씹어줄게 스타의 저녁에
World Business (bang bang) 핵심
섭외 1순위 (clap clap) 매진
많지 않지 이 class 가칠 만끽
좋은 향기에 악췬 반칙
Mic mic bungee
Mic mic bungee
Bright light 전진
망할 거 같았겠지만 I'm fine, sorry
미안해 Billboard
미안해 worldwide
아들이 넘 잘나가서 미안해 엄마
대신해줘 니가 못한 효도
우리 콘서트 절대 없어 포도
I do it, I do it 넌 맛없는 라따뚜이
혹 배가 아프다면 고소해 (sue it)
Did you see my bag?
Did you see my bag?
트로피들로 백이 가득해 (가득해, 가득해)
How you think 'bout that?
How you think 'bout that?
Hater들은 벌써 학을 떼 (학을 떼)
이미 황금빛 황금빛 나의 성공 (oh)
I'm so firin' firin' 성화봉송 (oh)
너는 황급히 황급히 도망 숑숑 (oh)
How you dare, how you dare, how you dare
내 손에 트로피 아 너무 많아
너무 heavy 내 두 손이 모잘라 (turn it up now)
Mic drop, mic drop
발 발 조심
너네 말 말 조심
Ladi dadi 아 너무 바빠
너무 busy 내 온몸이 모잘라 (turn it up now)
Mic drop, mic drop
발 발 조심
너네 말 말 조심
이거 완전 네 글자 (자)
사필귀정 ah (ah)
Once upon a time (time)
이솝우화 fly (fly)
니 현실을 봐라 쌔 쌤통
지금 죽어도 난 개행복 (turn it on)
이번엔 어느 나라 가 ooh
비행기 몇 시간을 타
Yeah, I'm on the mountain
Yeah, I'm on the bay
무대에서 탈진, mic drop, bam
Did you see my bag?
Did you see my bag?
트로피들로 백이 가득해 (가득해, 가득해)
How you think 'bout that?
How you think 'bout that?
Hater들은 벌써 학을 떼 (학을 떼)
이미 황금빛 황금빛 나의 성공 (oh)
I'm so firin' firin' 성화봉송 (oh)
너는 황급히 황급히 도망 숑숑 (oh)
How you dare, how you dare, how you dare
내 손에 트로피 아 너무 많아
너무 heavy 내 두 손이 모잘라 (turn it up now)
Mic drop, mic drop
발 발 조심
너네 말 말 조심
Ladi dadi 아 너무 바빠
너무 busy 내 온몸이 모잘라 (turn it up now)
Mic drop, mic drop
발 발 조심
너네 말 말 조심
Haters gonna hate
Players gon' play
Live a life, man, yeah
Ha, good luck
더 볼 일 없어 마지막 인사야
할 말도 없어 사과도 하지 마
더 볼 일 없어 마지막 인사야
할 말도 없어 사과도 하지 마
잘 봐 넌 그 꼴 나지
우린 탁 쏴 마치 콜라지
너의 각막 깜짝 놀라지
꽤 꽤 폼나지 포 포 폼나지 yeah






English Lyrics:
[J-Hope:]
Yeah, who says my spoon is filthy?
I don't care, when I grab the mic I beat them who got several golden spoons
And lash out, there are many rare steaks not cooked properly
Once again, I'll be chewing over and over at the star's dinner
Center of World Business
Number one favorite for casting sold out
Not many of this class, savor the value
Stinking is a foul with this good scent
Mic mic bungee

[Suga:]
Mic mic bungee
Bright lights, forward
You thought I was going down but I'm fine, sorry
My bad, "Billboard"
My bad, "worldwide"
Sorry mom, your son is so killing it
Should I chip in? For the duties you missed as a good child
We never have empty seats in our concert
I do it, I do it, you're a tasteless ratatouille
If you're so jealous and it hurts then find a lawsuit
Sue me
Sue it

[V, Jungkook, Jimin, Jin:]
Did you see my bag? (where?) Did you see my bag? (where?)
It's hella trophies and it's hella thick (hella thick, hella thick)
What you think 'bout that? (well) What you think 'bout that? (well)
I bet it got my haters hella sick (hella sick)
Come and follow me, follow me with your signs up
I'm so firin', firin', boy, your time's up
Keep on and runnin' and runnin' until I catch up
How you dare? How you dare? How you dare?

[Jungkook, RM & Suga:]
Another trophy, my hands carry 'em
Too many that I can't even count 'em (turn it up now)
Mic drop, mic drop
Careful of your feet, careful of what you say

[Jimin, RM & J-Hope:]
Somebody stop me, I'm 'bout to pop off
Too busy, you know my body ain't enough (turn it up now)
Mic drop, mic drop
Careful of your feet, careful of what you say

[RM:]
Baby, watch your mouth (mouth), it come back around (round)
Once upon a time (time), we learnt how to fly (fly)
Go look at your mirror, same damn clothes (git)
You know how I feel, freakin' happy (turn up)
How many hours do we fly?
I keep on dreamin' on the cloud
Yeah, I'm on the mountain, yeah, I'm on the bay (pop)
Everyday we vibin', mic drop, baam

[Jungkook, V, Jimin, Jin:]

[Rap Monster:]
Haters gon' hate
Players gon' play

Good luck

[All:]
No need to see you anymore, this is the last farewell
Got no words to say, don't even apologize
No need to see you anymore, this is the last farewell
Got no words to say, don't even apologize
See, you end up just like that
Just so fizzy, we're like Coca-Cola
Your corneas gets shocked when it sees us
'Cause we're just too stylish
